**Intro**

  This program is designed to store a list of songs into a database using the SQLite library. Its main purpose is to serve
  as an app to store a song anywhere without the usage of a PC or WiFi, but is not limited to just songs. This application
  can also be used as a way to store a list of groceries or a list of whatever that needs to be put saved for later. This 
  program showcases as much as I've learned in Mobile Development as well as from outside sources on Swift and XCode.
  
**Installation & Running**
  1. Extract the .zip file into a folder or a suitable location
  2. Open with AutoLayoutIBApp.xcworkspace
  3. Run by clicking on the run button in XCode
